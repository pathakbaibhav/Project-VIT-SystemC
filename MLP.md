### Step-by-Step Process for MLP Classification Block

1. Receive Input
   - The MLP block receives the output from the Transformer block, which is a matrix of size \((N+1) \times D\), where \(N\) is the number of patches and \(D\) is the dimension of each embedding vector. The "+1" accounts for the class token which is a special embedding that serves as a summary of the image's content.

2. Input Layer
The first layer of the MLP (which can sometimes be considered part of the Transformer's final layer) typically processes the class token embedding vector only, which is intended to represent the aggregated information of the entire input image.
This layer might normalize or otherwise preprocess the class token data before passing it on to subsequent layers.

3. Hidden Layers
Linear Transformation: Each neuron in a hidden layer computes a weighted sum of its inputs, which are the outputs from the previous layer (starting with the class token from the input layer).
Activation Function: After the weighted sum is computed, an activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn more complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

4. Output Layer
The final layer of the MLP is tailored to the specific classification task. For binary classification, this might be a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function that outputs a probability score. For multi-class classification, it could consist of multiple neurons (one for each class), typically using a softmax function to output a probability distribution across the classes.

5. Loss Function Calculation
During training, the output of the MLP is compared to the true labels using a loss function. For classification tasks, cross-entropy loss is commonly used.
The loss provides a measure of how well the MLP's predictions match the actual labels.

6. Backpropagation
To update the weights of the network, backpropagation is used. This involves computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network by applying the chain rule.
These gradients inform how the weights should be adjusted to minimize the loss.

7. Weight Update (Optimization)
An optimizer updates the weights based on the gradients calculated during backpropagation. Common optimizers include SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), Adam, and RMSprop. These optimizers might also adjust learning rates or use techniques like momentum to converge more efficiently.

8. Iteration/Epoch Completion
The above steps are repeated for each batch of data in the training set. One complete pass through all the training data is called an epoch.
Training usually continues for many epochs until the model's performance on some validation set ceases to improve significantly.

9. Evaluation and Testing
After training, the MLP is evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to quantify how well the model is performing.

10. Deployment
Once trained and validated, the MLP model can be deployed to classify new images or data points in a production environment.

### Notes
- If the model is already pre-trained, steps involving training (5-8) might be skipped or modified for fine-tuning.
- In some implementations, especially those not strictly following the original ViT architecture, additional preprocessing or normalization steps might be included either before the MLP block or within its layers.
