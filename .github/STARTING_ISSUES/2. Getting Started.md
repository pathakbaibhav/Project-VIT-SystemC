# 2. GEMM-ACC Skeleton

This issue creates a copy of vector_processor to act as a skeleton for gemm_proc. It shows how to connect the new processor up in both the testbench (for SWEmu) and zynq_demo (for QEMU simulation)

## 1. Preparation 
1.  Copy vector_processor source files into gemm_processor and commit unmodified code as starting point (in the `hw` directory)
2.  Rename class from `vector_processor` to `gemm_processor`
3.  Update Makefile to also compile gemm_processor for both testbench and zynq_demo
    ```make
    SC_OBJS += debugdev.o vector_processor.o gemm_processor.o
    ```

## 2. Instanciate and Connect GEMM Proc

 Update testbench.cc and zync_demo.cc to instanciate the gemm_processor (basically follow all traces of vectProc and add gemmProc equivalents)

1. gemm_processor will be located at address 0x4A000000ULL
2. increase the main interconnect `bus` to have one additional slave: `#define NR_DEVICES 3`
3. bind the target socket to the main interconnect so that the CPU can interact with the vector processor. Note we give it an address space of 512KByte for data + 255 bytes for mmr. 

    ```C++
    // map gemmProc target (slave) device with base address
    // so that CPU (SWEmu) can communicate to it. 
    // Use 255 bytes of MMR and 512KB of data
    bus.memmap(GEMM_PROC_BASE, + 0x100 + 512*1024 - 1,
                ADDRMODE_RELATIVE, -1, gemmProc.socket);
    ```
4. connect the interrupt line from the gemm_processor 
    - in testbench.cc create a new  'irqGEMMProc', bind the gemm_processor to it and connect it to IRQ2 of SWEmu (disconnecting the vector_processor's irq line)

        ```C++
        gemmProc.irq(irqGemmProc);
        swEmu.irq2(irqGemmProc);
        ```
    - in zynq_demo.cc connect it to the Zynq defined interrupt signal `zynq.pl2ps_irq[2]`
        ```C++
        gemmProc.irq(zynq.pl2ps_irq[2]);
        swEmu.irq2(zynq.pl2ps_irq[2]);
        ```

## 3. Access Validation 

Update SWEnv to validate you can communicate with the new gemmProc at the correct address range (even if it currently only implements the old vector processor).
